# 😻 Kedi Tv

A customizable home theater app (using Electron). It's an unfinished (and will probably not be finished) project. I've met with NVIDIA's SHIELD TV PRO, so I don't know if I'll ever work on this project 😅🤷‍♂️.

It only demonstrates a flat UI with keyboard navigation support. Apart from that, it does nothing.
